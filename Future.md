# Big Vision / Future Considerations
Probably a bit too large in that it won't do anything well.  Start project and then narrow in on a few of these components.  Also could split this into multiple projects.

### Scheduler
- (start) batch pull
- streaming pull
- batch push
- streaming push 

### Extraction Request
- (start) api (no auth)
- api (static auth)
- api (dynamic auth)

### Data
- single timeseries definition
- able to combine data to create new timeseries data

### Store
- (start) memory
- (start) csv/filefolders
- database

### Interaction tools
- server
- api to grab data in memory
- cli
- configuration file?

### Monitoring - for using the data
- Alerts
- Spawn tasks when alerts hit
